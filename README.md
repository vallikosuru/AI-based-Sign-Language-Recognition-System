# AI-based Sign Language Recognition System

A machine learning project that recognizes sign language gestures using AI techniques. This system aims to facilitate communication by converting sign language into text or speech.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow 
- NumPy  
- Pandas  

## 📖 Project Overview

This project uses computer vision and deep learning to detect and recognize sign language gestures from video input or images. The trained model can predict the sign language symbol and help bridge communication gaps for people who use sign language.


## 💡 Features

- Real-time sign language recognition using webcam  
- Image/video processing for gesture detection  
- Trained model for accurate classification  


## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd AI-based-Sign-Language-Recognition-System
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the main application:
   python inference_classifier.py


## 📈 What I Learned

- Building a computer vision pipeline  
- Training deep learning models for image classification  
- Real-time gesture recognition using video streams  
- Handling dataset preprocessing and augmentation
